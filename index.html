                    <p>
                        I am a <strong>software engineering</strong> student from <em>New Jersey, USA</em>.
                        I write code in my free time and usually publish it as FOSS on <a href="https://github.com/alerithe">GitHub</a>.
                        I have been working in languages such as Java, C#, and JavaScript for several years and would
                        say that I have become fairly proficient in them by now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As far as experience with Operating Systems, I have been daily-driving Microsoft Windows since
                        late-2017, switching from Mac OS X/macOS after roughly five years. I also have some limited
                        experience with Linux-based systems, but enough to understand how to use the Command-Line
                        Interface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do have plans to make a full switch to Linux, however, certain Windows-only applications and a
                        petty, Out-of-Date distaste for Wine has held me back. I've recently been looking into
                        distributions such as Fedora Linux, Debian, Manjaro, and Ubuntu.
